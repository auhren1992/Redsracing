# Warp Session Transcript Placeholder (2025-10-01)

This file preserves a durable record of the Warp AI session so you can quickly pick up the context on any machine.

Note: Full raw chat history isn’t programmatically retrievable here, so this document captures a structured summary of all actions, decisions, and key snippets performed during the session. See the companion file `docs/session-summary.md` for an even more concise checklist.

## Timeline and Key Actions

- Git recovery and deploy fixes
  - Aborted a stuck rebase, restored commit ability, aligned `main` to `origin/main`.
  - Ensured branch tracking and removed divergent remotes; cleaned up feature branch after fast-forward merge.
  - Fixed Firebase Hosting deployment error by removing a stale Cloud Run rewrite to a non-existent service (`speedhive-go-service`).
  - Deployed successfully to production hosting: `redsracing-a7f8b`.

- Jonny page: “Kids Edition” redesign
  - New hero with background image `assets/images/jonny-hero3.jpg` and Rookie Sensation wording preserved.
  - Interactive Speed Lab: gas/brake/nitro, speed trail >80%, mute toggle; added WebAudio nitro/brake sound effects.
  - Sticker Garage: drag-and-drop emoji stickers with reset.
  - Rookie Quiz: expanded to 10+ questions; added confetti success screen.
  - Gallery: re-enabled upload panel with progress bar and preview; later upgraded to real Firebase Storage uploads under `jonny/` path.

- Docs consolidation
  - Moved numerous `.md` files into `/docs` while keeping `README.md` at root.

- Navigation fixes (tabs/menus stuck)
  - Removed conflicting inline nav handlers in `schedule.html`, `qna.html`, and `leaderboard.html` so all pages rely on the shared `navigation.js`. Menus/tabs now open correctly from those pages.

- Track-specific guidance and quizzes
  - Added track-aware tips and quiz add-ons for: Grundy, Dells, Golden Sands, Slinger, Tomah, La Crosse, Blackhawk Farms (asphalt only, no pit stops).
  - Added a track filter above the quiz; list is sourced from the same Firestore races used by `schedule.html`.
  - Replaced “Pit Etiquette” with “Grid & Caution Etiquette”.

- Repo hygiene
  - Ensured consistent use of module scripts and removed duplicate, page-scoped UI JS where it conflicted with shared scripts.

## Files Touched (high level)

- `jonny.html` – Kids Hero + Speed Lab + Sticker Garage + Quiz/tips plumbing; visuals and copy updates.
- `assets/js/jonny-kids.js` – Interactivity (speed lab, stickers, quiz, confetti, gallery upload w/ Firebase Storage, track filter).
- `firebase.json` – Removed Cloud Run rewrite to fix deploy.
- `schedule.html`, `qna.html`, `leaderboard.html` – Removed inline nav JS; rely on `navigation.js`.
- `/docs` – Moved Markdown docs.

## Deploys

- Firebase Hosting (production): succeeded multiple times; live at:
  - https://redsracing-a7f8b.web.app

## Next Steps (optional)

- Create `jonny-tips.html` to split Tips & Quiz out of `jonny.html` with a small tab-style subnav.
- Switch track matching to a dedicated `race.track` field in Firestore (fallback to `race.name`).
- Add a “Next Race Tips” ribbon (auto-picks next upcoming venue from Firestore) on Jonny pages.

## How to resume at home

1) Pull the latest code
```
 git clone https://github.com/auhren1992/Redsracing.git
 cd Redsracing
 git config pull.rebase true
 git config rebase.autostash true
 git checkout main
 git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
 git pull --rebase
```

2) Firebase CLI
```
 firebase.cmd login
 firebase.cmd use redsracing-a7f8b
```

3) Local preview
```
 npx serve -p 5500   # or: python -m http.server 5500
 # open http://localhost:5500/jonny.html
```

If you’d like the tabs subnav and a dedicated `jonny-tips.html`, say the word and I will build and deploy it.
