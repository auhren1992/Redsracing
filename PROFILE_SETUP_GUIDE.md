# User Profile and Achievements System - Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the new user profile and achievements system in RedsRacing.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Profiles
- **Complete Profile Management**: Users can create and edit their profiles with username, display name, bio, avatar, and favorite cars
- **Public Profile Viewing**: Anyone can view user profiles
- **Secure Editing**: Users can only edit their own profiles
- **Auto Profile Creation**: New users get default profiles created automatically

### 2. Achievements System
- **Achievement Management**: Comprehensive system for tracking user accomplishments
- **Admin Controls**: Team members can assign achievements to users
- **Achievement Categories**: Racing, performance, community, and sportsmanship achievements
- **Points System**: Each achievement has point values for gamification

### 3. Security & Authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for regular users vs team members
- **Secure API**: All endpoints properly authenticated and authorized
- **Firebase Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Firebase Auth

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

First, initialize the achievements in your Firestore database:

```bash
cd scripts
python init_achievements.py
```

This will create `sample_achievements.json` and print Firestore console commands. Follow the printed instructions to add achievements to your Firestore database.

### 2. Firebase Configuration

The following collections will be created in Firestore:
- `user_profiles`: User profile data
- `achievements`: Available achievements/badges  
- `user_achievements`: User-earned achievements mapping

The Firestore security rules have been updated to handle these new collections with appropriate permissions.

### 3. Backend Deployment

The Python Cloud Functions have been updated with new endpoints:
- `GET /profile/{user_id}`: Get user profile and achievements
- `PUT /profile/{user_id}`: Update user profile (own profile only)
- `GET /achievements`: List all available achievements
- `POST /assign_achievement`: Assign achievement to user (admin only)

Deploy the functions using Firebase CLI:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:python-api
```

### 4. Frontend Access

The new profile page is available at `/profile.html`. Users can:
- View their own profile or other users' profiles
- Edit their profile information (username, display name, bio, avatar, favorite cars)
- See their earned achievements
- Admins can assign achievements to users when viewing other profiles
